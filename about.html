<h1>About Phyzixus</h1>

<p>
Phyzixus is a personal physics platform created to document my
journey in applied physics, research-oriented learning, and
technology-focused problem solving.
</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I am a postgraduate in Physics, with a strong academic background
and a deep interest in applying fundamental physics to real-world
systems. My areas of focus include electromagnetism, semiconductor
and device physics, materials science, quantum technology, and
nuclear physics.
</p>

<p>
This platform reflects my preparation for competitive examinations
such as GATE, CSIR-NET, and research-oriented roles in national
laboratories and technology-driven sectors.
</p>

<h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To build strong conceptual clarity in core physics domains</li>
  <li>To document applied and project-based learning</li>
  <li>To connect theory with devices and technology</li>
  <li>To create a long-term academic and research portfolio</li>
</ul>
